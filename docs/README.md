# Spartan Engine [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/677302405263785986?label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/TG5r2BS)

<p>An engine which is the result of my never-ending quest to understand how things work and has become my go-to place for research. It's designed around the philosophy of favoring fast real-time solutions over baked/static ones, a spartan approach offering a truly dynamic experience.</p>

<p>If you're also on the lookout for knowledge, then you might find this engine to be a helpful study resource. This is because a lot of effort goes into into building and maintaining a clean, modern and overall high quality architecture, an architecture that will ensure continuous development over the years ;-) </p>

- 20+ audio file formats support (FMOD)
- 30+ image file formats support (FreeImage)
- 40+ model file formats support (Assimp)
- Vulkan and DirectX 11 backends (same HLSL shaders compile everywhere)
- Deferred rendering with transparency (under a single render path and using the same shaders)
- Principled BSDF supporting anisotropic, clearcoat and cloth materials (combined with things like normal mapping, parallax, masking, occlusion etc)
- Bloom (Based on a study of Resident Evil 2's RE Engine)
- Volumetric lighting
- Lights with physical units (lux for directional, candelas for point and spot lights)
- Shadows with penumbra and colored translucency (Cascaded and omnidirectional shadow mapping with Vogel filtering)
- SSAO (Screen space ambient occlusion)
- SSR (Screen space reflections)
- SSS (Screen space shadows)
- TAA (Temporal anti-aliasing based on Uncharted 4)
- Physically based camera (Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO)
- Depth of field (controlled by the aperture of the camera)
- Motion blur (controlled by the shutter speed of the camera)
- Real-time shader editor
- Custom mip chain generation (Higher texture fidelity using Lanczos3 scaling)

- Post-process effects (Tone-Mapping, FXAA, Sharpening, Dithering, Chromatic aberration etc.)
- Physics (Rigid bodies, Constraints, Colliders)
- Entity-component system
- Event system

# Roadmap

##### v0.32-35 (WIP)
Feature     					 	| Completion 	| Notes 
:-          					 	| :-         	| :-
Screen space global illumination 	| 100%		  	| One bounce of indirect diffuse and specular light
Depth-of-field					 	| 100%       	| Controlled by Camera aperture
C# scripting (Replace AngelScript) 	| 50%			| Using Mono (no engine API exposed yet)
Vulkan polishing 	 				| -		  		| Optimise to outperform D3D11 in all cases and improve stability, things which will also make the engine API better.
DirectX 12						 	| -				| Low priority, after the engine API has matured thanks to Vulkan, D3D12 will take little time to add.
Eye Adaptation 					 	| -          	| Low priority
Subsurface Scattering 			 	| -          	| Low priority
Ray traced shadows				 	| -          	| -
Ray traced reflections			 	| -          	| -
Linux support			 	        | -          	| Setup a virtual machine, get Vulkan running. Might bring new people into the project.

###### Future
- Skeletal Animation.
- Atmospheric Scattering.
- Dynamic resolution scaling.
- Export on Windows.
- UI components.
- Make editor more stylish.
